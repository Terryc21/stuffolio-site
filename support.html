      <h2 style="margin-top:0">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does Quick Add do on the Add Product screen?</summary>
        <p>Quick Add lets you capture the essentials fast — just a title, category, and a few optional details. It's perfect for when you want to log an item quickly and fill in more information later (or never).</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Use Quick Add when you're inventorying multiple items at once or don't have all the details handy. You can always edit the item later to add photos, warranty info, purchase price, and more.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I improve the effectiveness of information returned by AI assistants?</summary>
        <p>Even though Stuffolio works great with only partial information about a product, the more specific and accurate the details you provide, the better results you'll get from AI features:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Use real brand names</strong> — "KitchenAid" not "my mixer"</li>
          <li><strong>Include model numbers</strong> — "KSM150PSER" helps pinpoint exact specs, manuals, and parts</li>
          <li><strong>Take clear photos</strong> — Good lighting, full product visible, labels/nameplates if possible</li>
          <li><strong>Add the product category</strong> — Helps AI understand context (e.g., "stand mixer" vs just a photo)</li>
          <li><strong>For vintage/antique items</strong> — Mention approximate age or era if known ("1960s" or "inherited from grandmother")</li>
          <li><strong>Include distinguishing details</strong> — Color, size, variant (e.g., "5-quart, Empire Red")</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Generic entries like "kitchen thing" or blurry photos will get generic results. Real product details unlock specific manuals, replacement parts, recall info, and accurate valuations.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I need to enter receipts for every item?</summary>
        <p>No. Stuffolio works with whatever information you have. Add a name and photo now, fill in details later — or don't. It's designed for real life, not perfect record-keeping. That being said, using real product, brand names, and model numbers will increase the usefullness of information returned by AI agents.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is Stuff Scout?</summary>
        <p>Stuff Scout is a cool AI tool that can help you identify items from photos. Just point your camera at something, and it'll tell you what it is, share a little bit about its history, and give you an idea of its value. It's especially handy for heirlooms you already have and for spotting those hidden gems at the thrift store.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I improve Stuff Scout results?</summary>
        <p>If Stuff Scout's initial identification isn't quite right, you can refine the results:</p>
        <ol style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Tap "Not quite right?"</strong> on the results screen</li>
          <li><strong>Add what you know</strong> — product name, manufacturer, model number, or era</li>
          <li><strong>Add photos</strong> — snap pictures of maker's marks, labels, stamps, or different angles</li>
          <li><strong>Tap Re-analyze</strong> — the AI reconsiders with your hints</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Tips for best results:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
          <li>Photos of maker's marks or signatures are especially helpful</li>
          <li>Be specific — "Homer Laughlin Virginia Rose" works better than "old plate"</li>
          <li>Mention where you found it or any known history</li>
          <li>Include visible markings, stamps, or patent numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Each refinement uses 1 AI query from your allowance, but it's worth it for accurate identification and valuation.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does Stuffolio sync across devices?</summary>
        <p>Yes, if you enable iCloud sync. Your data syncs through your personal iCloud account — we never see it. You can also use Stuffolio completely offline with no sync.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I export my inventory?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Export to CSV, PDF, or other formats from the Actions section. Great for insurance documentation, moving, or just having a backup.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; font-size:.9rem;"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Exported inventories are for informational purposes only. Contact your insurance agent for specific requirements on how to document and submit a claim.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Your inventory stays on your device by default. Network features (sync, AI, barcode lookup) are all opt-in. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do warranty reminders work?</summary>
        <p>Add a warranty expiration date to any item and Stuffolio will remind you before it expires. You can customize how far in advance you want to be notified in Settings.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What are coverage phases (tiered warranties)?</summary>
        <p>Many warranties change coverage over time. For example, a 5-year appliance warranty might offer:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Full coverage (parts + labor)</li>
          <li><strong>Years 2-3:</strong> Parts only (you pay for labor)</li>
          <li><strong>Years 4-5:</strong> Limited coverage</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Stuffolio lets you track these phases so you always know what's covered right now. You can add multiple coverage phases to any warranty, each with its own coverage type, date range, and deductible.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>To add coverage phases:</strong> Open a product, scroll to Warranty, tap "Coverage Details," then tap "Add Coverage Phase." Stuffolio will notify you when coverage is about to change.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What do the coverage types mean?</summary>
        <p>Stuffolio supports four coverage types to match real-world warranty terms:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Full Coverage</strong> — Both parts and labor are covered. The manufacturer handles everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Parts Only</strong> — Replacement parts are covered, but you pay for labor/installation costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Labor Only</strong> — Labor costs are covered, but you pay for replacement parts.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited</strong> — Partial coverage with restrictions. Check your warranty terms for details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">If you don't set a coverage type, Stuffolio assumes "Full Coverage" — which is how most single-phase warranties work.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I track warranty deductibles?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Many warranties (especially extended warranties) require a deductible — an out-of-pocket cost you pay when making a claim.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">You can set a deductible for the entire warranty, or different deductibles for each coverage phase. For example, an extended warranty might have no deductible for the first year, then a $50 deductible for years 2-5.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">The product detail view shows your current deductible based on which coverage phase is active.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I track items I've sold or donated?</summary>
        <p>Yes. When you let go of something, you can mark it as sold, donated, gifted, recycled, returned, or trashed. Stuffolio keeps a history so you know where everything went.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">For tax purposes, Stuffolio tracks:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
          <li><strong>Donations</strong> — Estimated fair market value, recipient organization, and date</li>
          <li><strong>Sales</strong> — Sale price, date, and where/to whom it was sold</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">You can export this information for your records. Attach photos of donation receipts to keep everything in one place.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; font-size:.9rem;"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Stuffolio provides record-keeping tools only. Consult a tax professional for advice on deductions and reporting requirements.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I delete an item?</summary>
        <p>Open the item's detail view, tap the action menu (•••), and select "Delete." You can also swipe left on an item in the list view. Deleted items are gone permanently — if you might want to reference it later, consider marking it as "disposed" instead.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I organize items by room or location?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Each item can have a location assigned (living room, garage, kitchen, etc.). You can then filter and search by location to see everything in a specific area — helpful for moving or insurance documentation.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is there a limit to how many items I can add?</summary>
        <p>No. Add as many items as you want. Stuffolio stores everything locally on your device, so the only limit is your device's storage space. If you use iCloud sync, your iCloud storage applies.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I back up my data?</summary>
        <p>You have several options: (1) Enable iCloud sync to automatically back up to your iCloud account, (2) Export your inventory to CSV, PDF, or Excel from the Actions section, or (3) Your device's regular backup (iCloud Backup or Finder/iTunes) includes Stuffolio data.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What happens if I delete the app?</summary>
        <p>If you delete Stuffolio, locally stored data is removed from that device. However, if you have iCloud sync enabled, your data remains in iCloud and will restore when you reinstall. We recommend exporting a backup before deleting, just in case.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does Stuffolio work offline?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Core features work completely offline — adding items, viewing your inventory, editing details, and exporting. Only optional features like Stuff Scout (AI), barcode lookup, and iCloud sync require an internet connection.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can I attach receipts and documents?</summary>
        <p>Yes. You can attach photos of receipts, manuals, warranty cards, or any other documents to each item. Just open the item and use the attachments section to add images from your camera or photo library.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is Stuffolio free? Are there in-app purchases?</summary>
        <p>Stuffolio is a one-time purchase of $9.99. All core inventory features are included — adding items, tracking warranties, organizing by location, exporting data, and more.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>AI Features (Optional Subscription):</strong> Stuff Scout and other AI-powered features require a separate subscription due to ongoing server costs. Subscriptions are available monthly or annually — cancel anytime. Pricing will be finalized after beta testing.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">You can use Stuffolio fully without the AI subscription. The core app works great on its own.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I enable internet features like AI and barcode lookup?</summary>
        <p>Internet-connected features are disabled by default to protect your privacy. To enable them, go to <strong>Settings → Network Features</strong> and toggle on the features you want to use. You can enable:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Stuff Scout (AI)</strong> — Identify items from photos and get product research</li>
          <li><strong>Barcode Lookup</strong> — Auto-fill product info by scanning barcodes</li>
          <li><strong>Recall Checker</strong> — Check if your products have safety recalls</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — Help improve Stuffolio by sharing anonymous usage data</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Each feature can be enabled or disabled individually. Core inventory features always work offline — no internet required.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is Legacy Wishes?</summary>
        <p>Legacy Wishes helps you document who should receive your belongings. It's a way to record your preferences for family heirlooms, collectibles, and meaningful items — so your wishes are clear when the time comes.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
          <li><strong>Add Recipients</strong> — Family members, friends, or charities who may receive items</li>
          <li><strong>Assign Items</strong> — From any product's detail view, assign it to a recipient</li>
          <li><strong>Set Fallbacks</strong> — Choose what happens if a recipient can't accept (donate, sell, let family decide)</li>
          <li><strong>Share</strong> — Export as PDF or share in-app with family members</li>
          <li><strong>Family Collaboration</strong> — Optionally let recipients indicate interest in items</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Enable Legacy Wishes in <strong>Settings → Legacy Planning</strong>. This feature is disabled by default.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; font-size:.9rem;"><strong>Important:</strong> Legacy Wishes is for personal record-keeping only — it is not a legal will or binding document. Consult an attorney for legally binding arrangements.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is "Repair, Keep, or Replace?"</summary>
        <p>Repair, Keep, or Replace? is a thinking tool that helps you decide what to do with an item — it's not a shopping funnel. Unlike typical "replacement advisor" features, it uses your own data as the primary source of truth.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>What it shows:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-top:8px;">
          <li><strong>Repair Options</strong> — Links to iFixit repair guides, repairability scores, DIY difficulty ratings, and repair vs. replace cost comparison</li>
          <li><strong>Lifespan Analysis</strong> — Item age, expected lifespan, warranty status, and estimated remaining value</li>
          <li><strong>Brand Intelligence</strong> — Your history with this brand: average ratings, would-buy-again rate, other items from the same manufacturer</li>
          <li><strong>Research Tips</strong> — How to find trustworthy product reviews (Consumer Reports, Wirecutter, iFixit, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Confidence levels:</strong> The advisor tells you how confident its suggestions are — High (complete data), Medium (partial data), or Exploratory (limited data). It won't pretend to know more than it does.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>To access:</strong> Open any product, tap the action menu (•••), and select <strong>Repair, Keep, or Replace?</strong>. You can also find it in Rating Insights for items you've rated.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px; font-size:.9rem;"><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Your own ratings, brand history, and experience are the most trustworthy data you have. This feature surfaces that first, then offers tools to help you think — not shop.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What's the difference between Go To and Product Search?</summary>
        <p><strong>Go To (⌘K)</strong> and <strong>Product Search</strong> serve different purposes:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top:10px;">
          <li><strong>Go To</strong> — A command palette for navigating the app. Use it to jump to features, launch actions (Add Product, Export, Backup), access tools (AI Assistant, Recall Check), open settings, or get help. It searches app functions, not your products.</li>
          <li><strong>Product Search</strong> — Found in My Products, this searches your actual inventory. Use it to find specific items by name, brand, model, category, location, or any other product details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>Quick rule:</strong> Use <strong>Go To</strong> to do something in the app. Use <strong>Product Search</strong> to find something you own.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">Go To is available from anywhere via ⌘K (Mac/iPad with keyboard) or the toolbar button. Product Search is always visible at the top of My Products.</p>

        <summary>iCloud sync isn't working</summary>
        <p>Make sure iCloud is enabled in your device settings and you're signed in with the same Apple ID on all devices. Try force-quitting the app and reopening. If issues persist, check your iCloud storage isn't full.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>AI features aren't loading</summary>
        <p>First, make sure you've opted in to AI features: go to <strong>Settings → Network Features</strong> and enable <strong>Stuff Scout</strong>. AI features are disabled by default to protect your privacy.</p>
        <p>If already enabled, check your internet connection and try again. If you're on a restricted network (work, school), the AI server might be blocked.</p>

      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Photos aren't saving</summary>
        <p>Make sure Stuffolio has permission to access your photos. Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Photos and check that Stuffolio has access.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Barcode scanner not working</summary>
        <p>Make sure Stuffolio has camera permission (Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera). Also check that Network Features are enabled in Stuffolio settings for product lookup. Try scanning in better lighting, and make sure your camera lens is clean.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Warranty reminders / notifications aren't working</summary>
        <p>Make sure Stuffolio has notification permission (Settings → Notifications → Stuffolio). Check that you've set a warranty expiration date on the item. Also verify your notification timing preference in Stuffolio Settings — you can choose how far in advance to be reminded. For coverage phase change alerts (Full → Parts Only transitions), make sure "Coverage Phase Changes" is enabled in Settings → Notifications.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>App is running slowly</summary>
        <p>Try force-quitting and reopening the app. If you have a very large inventory with many photos, this can affect performance. Make sure your device has available storage space. Restarting your device can also help clear memory.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>My data seems to have disappeared</summary>
        <p>Don't panic! First, check if you're signed into the same iCloud account (if using sync). Try force-quitting and reopening the app. If you recently restored your device, make sure iCloud sync is enabled and give it time to download. If data is truly lost, contact us — we'll help troubleshoot.</p>
