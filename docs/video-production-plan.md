---

### Tutorial 1: Getting Started with Stuffolio
**Duration:** 2:30
**Audience:** New users
**Goal:** First item added, basic navigation understood

**Script:**

```
INTRO (0:00-0:15)
[Screen: Stuffolio app icon]
"Welcome to Stuffolio — the personal inventory app that helps you track what you own, protect your warranties, and remember what matters."

DASHBOARD TOUR (0:15-0:45)
[Screen: Dashboard]
"When you open Stuffolio, you'll see your Dashboard. This is your home base.

At the top, you'll see stats about your inventory — total items and total value.

Below that, the Needs Attention card shows warranties expiring soon, overdue maintenance, and anything flagged for review.

And these Quick Action buttons let you add items fast — scan a barcode, add manually, or use AI to identify something."

ADDING YOUR FIRST ITEM (0:45-1:30)
[Screen: Add Product]
"Let's add your first item. Tap the plus button.

You can use Quick Add if you just want to capture the basics — name, category, maybe a photo. Perfect for when you're inventorying a whole room.

Or tap Full Details to enter everything: purchase date, price, warranty info, serial number, location, and notes.

I'll add my coffee maker. [Type name, select category, add photo]

Tap Save, and it's in your inventory."

FINDING YOUR STUFF (1:30-2:00)
[Screen: My Products]
"To see everything you've added, tap My Products.

You can search by name, filter by category or location, and switch between list and grid view.

Tap any item to see its full details, edit it, or take action — like marking it as sold or donated."

WRAP UP (2:00-2:30)
[Screen: Dashboard]
"That's the basics! As you add more items, Stuffolio will track your warranties, remind you before they expire, and keep everything organized.

In the next tutorial, we'll cover warranty tracking and how to set up coverage phases.

Thanks for watching — and welcome to Stuffolio."
```

---

### Tutorial 2: Mastering Warranty Tracking
**Duration:** 2:00
**Audience:** Users with items added
**Goal:** Understand warranty phases, reminders, and Apple Wallet

**Script:**

```
INTRO (0:00-0:15)
[Screen: Product with warranty]
"Most inventory apps just track an expiration date. Stuffolio tracks how your coverage actually changes over time."

THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:35)
[Screen: Example warranty document]
"Here's a typical appliance warranty: Year 1 is full coverage — parts and labor. Years 2-3, you pay for labor. Years 4-5, it's limited to certain parts.

When you need a repair, do you remember which phase you're in? Stuffolio does."

ADDING WARRANTY PHASES (0:35-1:15)
[Screen: Product edit → Warranty section]
"Open any product and scroll to Warranty.

Tap Coverage Details, then Add Coverage Phase.

I'll add three phases for this dishwasher:
- Phase 1: Full Coverage, years 1
- Phase 2: Parts Only, years 2-3
- Phase 3: Limited, years 4-5

Now Stuffolio shows which phase is active TODAY, and will notify you when coverage is about to change."

APPLE WALLET (1:15-1:40)
[Screen: Add to Wallet flow]
"Need proof of warranty at a repair shop? Tap Add to Wallet.

Stuffolio creates a pass with your product name, warranty status, and expiration date.

Now you can show your coverage without even opening the app."

REMINDERS (1:40-2:00)
[Screen: Settings → Notifications]
"By default, Stuffolio reminds you 30 days before warranty expiration. You can adjust this in Settings.

Never miss your chance to get a repair covered."
```

---

### Tutorial 3: Stuff Scout — AI Identification
**Duration:** 1:45
**Audience:** Users curious about AI features
**Goal:** Successfully identify an item, understand value estimates

**Script:**

```
INTRO (0:00-0:15)
[Screen: Stuff Scout icon]
"Found something at an estate sale? Inherited a mystery item? Stuff Scout uses AI to identify it and estimate its value."

USING STUFF SCOUT (0:15-0:55)
[Screen: Stuff Scout camera]
"From the Dashboard, tap Scout — or find it in Actions.

Point your camera at the item. Try to get good lighting and capture any maker's marks or labels.

Tap Analyze.

[Wait for results]

Stuff Scout identifies this as a McCoy pottery vase from the 1940s. It shows the maker, approximate date, and a value range based on recent sales."

REFINING RESULTS (0:55-1:25)
[Screen: Results with "Not quite right?" option]
"If the identification isn't quite right, tap 'Not quite right?'

You can add what you know — maybe you saw a maker's mark, or you know it's from your grandmother's era.

Add another photo of the bottom or any markings.

Tap Re-analyze, and Stuff Scout tries again with your hints."

SAVING TO INVENTORY (1:25-1:45)
[Screen: Save flow]
"Happy with the results? Tap Save to Inventory.

Stuff Scout pre-fills the details — name, description, estimated value, and your photos.

Review, edit if needed, and tap Save. Done!"
```

---

### Tutorial 4: Keyboard Shortcuts & Power User Tips (Mac)
**Duration:** 1:30
**Audience:** Mac users who want efficiency
**Goal:** Learn Go To menu and navigation shortcuts

**Script:**

```
INTRO (0:00-0:10)
[Screen: Mac app]
"If you use Stuffolio on Mac, these shortcuts will save you serious time."

GO TO MENU (0:10-0:45)
[Screen: Go To menu in action]
"Press Command-K to open the Go To menu.

This is your command center. Start typing what you want:
- 'add' jumps to Add New Product
- 'warranty' opens the Warranty Report
- 'export' takes you to Export Data

It searches actions, navigation, reports, and settings. You can get anywhere without touching the sidebar."

QUICK NAVIGATION (0:45-1:10)
[Screen: Switching views with shortcuts]
"For the main sections, use Command plus a number:
- Command-1: Dashboard
- Command-2: My Products
- Command-3: Actions
- Command-4: Insights
- Command-5: Stuff Scout
- Command-6: Legacy Wishes

And Command-N to add a new product from anywhere."

WRAP UP (1:10-1:30)
[Screen: Quick Reference Card on website]
"Want a printable cheat sheet? Visit stuffolio.app/quick-reference for a one-page card with all shortcuts.

Now go be a power user."
```

### Tutorial 5: Exporting for Insurance
**Duration:** 1:30
**Audience:** Users preparing for insurance documentation
**Goal:** Generate a professional inventory report

**Script:**

```
INTRO (0:00-0:15)
[Screen: Insurance document imagery]
"If disaster strikes, you'll need proof of what you owned. Stuffolio makes it easy to create insurance-ready documentation."

WHAT TO INCLUDE (0:15-0:35)
[Screen: Well-documented item]
"For best results, make sure your valuable items have:
- Clear photos (multiple angles)
- Purchase price and date
- Serial numbers for electronics
- Receipts attached as photos

You don't need all of this, but more detail means faster claims."

GENERATING REPORTS (0:35-1:10)
[Screen: Actions → Export]
"Go to Actions, then Export.

Choose your format:
- PDF includes photos — great for sharing with your agent
- CSV is a spreadsheet — good for your records
- You can export everything or filter by category or location

I'll export my Electronics as PDF.

[Show PDF preview]

You get a professional document with photos, values, and details — ready to email or print."

WRAP UP (1:10-1:30)
[Screen: PDF saved]
"Pro tip: Export once a year and store it somewhere safe — cloud storage, email to yourself, or a safety deposit box.

When you need it, you'll be glad you have it."
```

## Notes

- **Consistency:** Use the same demo inventory across all videos for continuity
- **Tone:** Friendly, helpful, not salesy — "here's how this helps you"
- **Pacing:** Tutorials can breathe; GIFs should be snappy
- **Accessibility:** All videos need captions; GIFs need alt text on website
