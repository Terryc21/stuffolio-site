Ideas for Using Claude Code with Xcode
1. Install XcodebuildMCP early
Install XcodebuildMCP as soon as possible. It can multiply your productivity by automating the clean/build/test cycle after code changes, saving a huge amount of time and friction.
You don’t need to install it manually—simply instruct Claude Code to obtain and install XcodebuildMCP for you.
2. Create a CLAUDE.md file at the project root
Create a CLAUDE.md document and place it in the root directory of your project. Claude Code reads this at the beginning of every session and uses it as persistent project context.
In CLAUDE.md, define key parameters such as:
    • Tooling/versions: You are building an app using Xcode 26 on macOS 26. Without this, Claude may give faulty guidance (for example, telling you to find a menu item that has moved or been renamed).
    • Platforms: The app is multi-platform (e.g., macOS, iOS, watchOS, visionOS), so it generates accurate platform-specific logic and #if / #else suggestions.
    • Compatibility: The app should remain backward compatible with all macOS and iOS versions that are SwiftData-compatible (for example, iOS 17 and macOS 14).
    • Rules/decisions: Any architectural or policy decisions already made (accessibility standards, data model constraints, privacy rules), so you don’t have to restate them constantly.
As you reach meaningful milestones (for example, committing to WCAG accessibility or a specific data-sync strategy), explicitly instruct Claude Code to add those decisions to CLAUDE.md.
3. Periodically request a “Report Card” deep review
Every so often (especially after major changes), ask Claude Code to review your project and generate a comprehensive Report Card.
Ask for a structured report covering:
    • Security risks
    • UI and accessibility
    • Architecture and workflow
    • Performance and refactoring opportunities
Explicitly instruct it to rely on the actual source code, not just markdown or documentation. Then aim to improve the lowest grades and “earn” all A’s on the next report card.
4. Be intentional about prompt scope
Know when to ask:
    • Specific questions: “Why this approach instead of that?”
    • Exploratory questions: “What are your recommendations for improving ___?”
Switching deliberately between the two often yields better insights than staying in either open opr closed ended prompts.
5. Cross-check Claude Code with other AI tools
Try giving the same prompt to Claude Code and ChatGPT (or another AI agent). Then:
    1. Copy ChatGPT’s response back into Claude Code
    2. Ask: “What do you think of ChatGPT’s response to ___?”
The results can be surprisingly valuable—ranging from sharp criticism to genuine praise. You can then ask Claude Code to integrate the strongest parts of ChatGPT’s response into its own solution.  Claude Codes responses to me doing this has ranged from “GBT is hallucinating, the only reason to what GBT is recommending do this is for resume building” to “GBT’s analysis in insightful and much better thought out than my own in this regard...”
